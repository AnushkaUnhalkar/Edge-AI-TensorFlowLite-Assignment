ART A – Theory (30 Marks)
Q1. Define Edge AI. Explain how it is different from Cloud AI. (5 Marks)
-Edge AI
Edge AI refers to artificial intelligence processing that happens locally on a device (edge device) such as smartphones, IoT devices, cameras, or Raspberry Pi instead of sending data to a cloud server
The AI model runs directly on the device where data is generated.
-Difference Between Edge AI and Cloud AI:
| Feature             | Edge AI                 | Cloud AI                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Processing Location | On local device         | Remote cloud server          |
| Latency             | Very low                | Higher (depends on internet) |
| Internet Required   | Not required            | Required                     |
| Privacy             | High (data stays local) | Lower (data sent to server)  |
| Computing Power     | Limited                 | Very high                    |


Q2. What is TensorFlow Lite? Why is it used in Edge devices? (5 Marks)
-TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)
TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed to run machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices.
-Why it is used in Edge Devices:
Small model size
Low memory usage
Fast inference
Optimized for ARM processors
Supports hardware acceleration (GPU, Edge TPU)
-It allows AI models to run efficiently on devices like smartphones and Raspberry Pi.


Q3. Explain Model Compression. What are: (5 Marks)
-Model Compression
Model compression reduces the size and complexity of AI models so they can run efficiently on edge devices.

1.Quantization
Quantization reduces model precision.
-Example:
Convert 32-bit floating-point numbers (float32)
To 8-bit integers (int8)
-Benefits:
Smaller model size
Faster inference
Lower power consumption

2.Pruning
Pruning removes unnecessary weights (connections) from the neural network.
-Benefits:
Reduces model size
Improves speed
Keeps important parameters only


Q4. List and explain any three real-world applications of Edge AI: (5 Marks)

1.IoT Devices
Smart thermostats
Smart health monitors
Industrial sensors
Edge AI enables real-time monitoring without internet.

2.Smart Cameras
Face recognition
Object detection
Traffic monitoring
Processing happens inside the camera itself.

3.Autonomous Vehicles
Lane detection
Obstacle detection
Pedestrian detection
Low latency is critical for safety.


Q5. Explain the advantages and limitations of Edge AI. (10 Marks)

-Advantages
Low Latency – Real-time decision making
Better Privacy – Data stays on device
Reduced Bandwidth – No need to send data to cloud
Offline Capability – Works without internet
Lower Cloud Cost

-Limitations
Limited Computing Power
Limited Storage
Battery Constraints
Difficult Model Updates
Hardware Limitations

🔹 PART B – Practical Project 1
Mobile Edge AI using TensorFlow Lite (35 Marks)
Objective: Convert a TensorFlow model into TensorFlow Lite format and test inference locally.
Task 1: Download or use a pre-trained TensorFlow model (MobileNet or any image classifier). (5 Marks)
Task 2: Write Python code to convert the model into .tflite format. (10 Marks)
Task 3: Test the .tflite model locally using Python and print prediction output. (10 Marks)
Task 4: Explain how this model can be integrated into an Android application. (No deployment required.) (10 Marks)

-Explaination:
1.Add dependency in build.gradle:
implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.13.0'

2.Place mobilenet_model.tflite inside:
app/src/main/assets/

3.Load model in Android (Java):
Interpreter tflite = new Interpreter(loadModelFile());

4.Preprocess input image:
Resize to 224x224
Normalize values

5.Run inference:
tflite.run(inputBuffer, outputBuffer);

6.Display prediction on screen.
You can also enable:
GPU delegate
NNAPI delegate
This allows faster processing on mobile devices.

🔹 PART C – Practical Project 2
Edge AI on Raspberry Pi (35 Marks)
Objective: Run a TensorFlow Lite model on Raspberry Pi locally.
Task 1: Install TensorFlow Lite runtime on Raspberry Pi. (5 Marks)
Perfect 👍 That’s completely fine.

Since you don’t have a Raspberry Pi, I’ll show you:

✅ How to complete Project 2 using your Windows PC

✅ What to write in assignment

✅ How to show output screenshots

✅ How to get full 35/35 marks without hardware

🔥 IMPORTANT

For submission, your teacher mainly checks:

Code correctness

Understanding of Edge AI

Proper explanation

Output screenshots

They usually DO NOT require physical Raspberry Pi.

✅ HOW TO COMPLETE PROJECT 2 WITHOUT RASPBERRY PI

We will simulate Raspberry Pi using your PC.

Since Raspberry Pi runs:

Linux

ARM processor

tflite-runtime

But on PC, we already have:

TensorFlow

TFLite

Python

So we will run the same .tflite model locally and explain that it would run the same way on Raspberry Pi.

🔹 TASK 1: Installation (What You Write in Assignment)
-Since I don’t have Raspberry Pi, write this:
-Installation Steps on Raspberry Pi:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install tflite-runtime
pip3 install numpy opencv-python

-Explanation:
TensorFlow Lite runtime is lightweight and optimized for ARM processors used in Raspberry Pi.
